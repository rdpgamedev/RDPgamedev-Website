            I'm Richard Pittman, a game designer and programmer.  I've been playing games 
      since I was a five years old, and have since had a great passion for the 
      interactive art.  <br /><br />To me, interaction is the greatest dimension of entertainment -- 
      greater than the spatial, aural, and temporal, the interactive dimension provides for a
      myriad of possibilities for the player's experience of the interactive medium, and we're only
      just now beginning to explore those possibilities.
