            I'm Richard Pittman, a game designer and programmer.  
          I've been playing games since I was a five years old, 
          and have since had a great passion for the interactive art.  
            <br /><br />
          To me, interaction is the greatest dimension of entertainment -- 
          greater than the spatial, aural, and temporal, the interactive 
          dimension provides for a myriad of possibilities for the player's 
          experience of the interactive medium, and we're only just now 
          beginning to explore those possibilities.
